# Exercise 1
Complete the following function such that it returns a dictionary which associates a number of each letter of the alphabet.
As an example, it associates $1$ to A, $2$ to B and so on.
```python
def get_alphabet_dictionary():
    d = {'A':1,'B':2}
    return d
```
# Exercise 2
Using the function written above complete the following function such that
it receives a string as an argument and prints a numerical code obtained by replacing the letters of the string with their
numerical value.
```python
def get_code(s:str):  
      
```

# Exercise 3
Using the function `get_alphabeth_dictionary` written above complete the following function such that
it receives a string as an argument and returns a list which contains the numerical code of each letter of the string passed.
As an example, if we pass "ABC" it must return `[1,2,3]`. Use list comprehension.
```python
def get_code_list(s:str):
    l = []
    # populate the list 
    return l  
```
