# Exercise 1
Complete the following function such that it returns a dictionary which associates a number of each letter of the alphabet.
As an example, it associates $1$ to A, $2$ to B and so on.
```python
def get_alphabet_dictionary():
    d = {'A':1,'B':2}
    return d
```
# Exercise 2
Using the function written above complete the following function such that
it receives a string as an argument and prints a numerical code obtained by replacing the letters of the string with their
numerical value.
```python
def get_code(s:str):  
      
```

# Exercise 3
Using the function `get_alphabeth_dictionary` written above complete the following function such that
it receives a string as an argument and returns a list which contains the numerical code of each letter of the string passed.
As an example, if we pass "ABC" it must return `[1,2,3]`. Use list comprehension.
```python
def get_code_list(s:str):
    l = []
    # populate the list 
    return l  
```

# Exercise 4
Complete the following function such that, given a dictionary similar to that of Exercise 1, 
it returns a dictionary with the numerical values raised to the power of 2.
As an example, if the argument dictionary is `d1 = {'A': 3,'B': 2}` it must return `d2 = {'A':9,'B':4}`.
```python
def get_squared_codes(d:dict):
    """
    Given a dictionary which contains, for each key, a numerical value (similar to the one in exercise 1) 
    creates and returns a similar dictionary but such that the numerical value is squared.
    :return: dict
    """
    squared_dict = {l : d[l] ** 2 for l in d}
    return squared_dict
```
