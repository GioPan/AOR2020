    "# Getting solution information\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will see how to extract information from an optimization model, such as solution information. Gurobi has organized this information in so called *attributes*. Each component of an optimization model, i.e., the [Model object](https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/9.0/refman/py_model.html), the [variables objects](https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/9.0/refman/py_var.html) and the [constraints objects](https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/9.0/refman/py_constr.html) are provided with a method called `getAttr` which can be used to query their specific attributes, corresponding to solution and model information. A central exercise is thus that of understanding which attributes can be queried from each object. The full list of attributes for each object is provided in the Gurobi documentation [here](https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/9.0/refman/attributes.html#sec:Attributes). This page should be kept at hand when working with optimization models."

This method can be used to query information about the model as well as information about sets of decision variables and constraints. Let us see some examples."
