    "In the first tutorial you have seen the basics of the interaction with Gurobi. We will now look at more realistic features such us creating multidimensional and sparse arrays of variables and constraints. Gurobi provides specialized data structures to efficiently handle these situations. Before moving further into this tutorial please go back to the [Python tutorial](../python_tutorial.ipynb) and refresh your mind on *lists*, *dictionaries*, *tuples* and *comprehension*."

Finally, let $x_{ijk}$ be the amount of product $k$ shipped from $i$ to $j$. The problem can be formulated as follows.\n",
